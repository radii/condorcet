# This election thingie works on Linux, Mac, or
# Windows.  If you have trouble with it, feel free
# to contact me: Ka-Ping Yee <ping@zesty.ca>.

# For each elected position, follow these steps:
#
# 1. Open a fresh copy of this START-HERE file
#    from the disk.  You'll enter ballots into
#    this file right here.  There is an example
#    after these instructions for you to edit.
#
# 2. In the example below, change "President" to
#    the name of the position.
#
# 3. In the example below, change "Alice Bob None"
#    to a list of the candidates.  Each name must
#    be one word, with spaces between the names.
#    You don't need to do anything special to
#    handle votes for "None of the above"; just
#    treat "None" like any other candidate.
#
# 4. Enter the ballots at the bottom of this file.
#    Each ballot should be on a single line with a
#    number for each candidate's ranking or a
#    hyphen for no ranking.  For example, if there
#    are 3 candidates, there should be 3 numbers
#    or hyphens on each line, separated by spaces.
#
# 5. Save this file somewhere safe.
#
# 6. Linux: Run the command "election.py" with
#           your filename as the first argument.
#    Mac OS: Drag the icon for your saved file
#            onto the "mac" icon on the CD.
#    Windows: Drag the icon for your saved file
#             onto the "windows" icon on the CD.
#
# 7. You should see the results appear in a new
#    window.  The results are automatically saved
#    to the folder where you saved your input.
