MAKING CHANGES
==============

To make another CD, just copy everything to it.

If you need to make changes to the election program, you can
edit election.py.  The programs "mac.app" and "windows.exe"
both launch election.py.

You should never need to change anything else.  If you need
to see how this CD was made, look in the "build" directory.

Feel free to contact me if you have any problems.
